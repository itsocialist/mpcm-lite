```
🚀 Launching MPCM-Pro: AI Development Team in Your Terminal!

Turn any app idea into working code in <60 seconds for <$0.10

Built this because I was tired of the gap between "AI can write code" and "I have a deployable app"

🧵 Here's what it does...

1/ MPCM-Pro orchestrates specialized AI agents like a real dev team:

Product Manager → analyzes your requirements
Frontend Dev → builds React components  
Backend Dev → creates APIs
DevOps → handles configuration

All working together seamlessly 🤝

2/ The magic: describe what you want in plain English

"Build a recipe sharing app with user profiles"

55 seconds later → complete Next.js app with:
✅ TypeScript
✅ Tailwind CSS  
✅ API routes
✅ Ready to deploy

Cost: $0.07 📉

3/ But here's the cool part - the Marketplace! 🏪

Need payments? The Stripe Expert role adds full integration
Need auth? Auth Specialist handles it
Need a database? Database Wizard sets up Prisma

Specialized AI expertise, on demand 🧠

4/ It works with Claude Desktop too!

Just say "Use the build_app tool to create..." and watch your AI assistant actually BUILD the app

This is what MCP was made for 🔥

5/ Everything is open source and MIT licensed

Built this as a spike in 2 days to prove the concept. Now ready for the community to help make it amazing!

GitHub: [link]
Demo: [link]

6/ What's next?

- Real marketplace with payments
- 50+ specialized roles
- Visual app builder
- Team collaboration
- Your ideas?

This is just v1.0. The goal: make custom software accessible to everyone 🌟

7/ Try it yourself!

```
git clone [repo]
npm install
npm run demo
```

Works with Claude API or OpenAI. First app is basically free to try.

Let me know what you build! 🚀

### 3. Product Hunt Launch Copy

**Tagline:** AI development team that builds apps in 60 seconds

**Description:**
MPCM-Pro orchestrates specialized AI agents to build complete, production-ready applications from a simple description. Just tell it what you want, and watch as AI Product Managers, Frontend Devs, Backend Devs, and DevOps Engineers collaborate to create your app. Average time: 55 seconds. Average cost: $0.07.

**First Comment:**
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built MPCM-Pro because I was frustrated with the gap between "AI can write code" and actually having a working app.

What makes this different:
- It's not just code generation - it's a full AI development team
- The apps actually work (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Marketplace for specialized capabilities (Stripe integration, auth, etc.)
- Integrates with Claude Desktop via MCP

This is an open-source project and I'd love your feedback on where to take it next!

### 4. Reddit Posts

```
I built an AI orchestration system that generates complete apps in 60 seconds

Hey r/programming!

Just released MPCM-Pro - it orchestrates multiple AI agents (PM, Frontend, Backend, DevOps) to build complete Next.js applications from natural language descriptions.

What's interesting technically:
- Multi-agent orchestration with context passing
- Role-based prompt engineering
- Encrypted marketplace for premium capabilities
- MCP protocol integration

Average app takes 55 seconds and costs $0.07 in API calls.

It's open source (MIT) and I'd love feedback from the community!

**r/SideProject:**
```
My weekend project: AI that builds entire apps for $0.07

Spent the weekend building MPCM-Pro - describe an app idea, get working code in under a minute.

It actually generates:
- Complete Next.js project
- React components with TypeScript
- API routes
- Tailwind styling
- All config files

The cool part: it uses multiple specialized AI agents working together, with a marketplace for premium features (like Stripe integration).

Would love feedback on the idea and what features to add next!
