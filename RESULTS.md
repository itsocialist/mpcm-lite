# MPCM-POC-Spike Results 🚀

## What Was Built in 20 Minutes

### Core Components
1. **Orchestrator Engine** - Chains multiple AI roles with context passing
2. **Role System** - PM, Frontend, Backend developers working in sequence
3. **Marketplace** - Encrypted premium roles with license validation
4. **App Generator** - Creates real, runnable Next.js applications
5. **Beautiful CLI** - Professional output with spinners and colors

### The Demo Flow
```
User: "Build a todo app with authentication"
  ↓
PM Role → Creates requirements
  ↓
Frontend Role → Builds React components  
  ↓
Backend Role → Creates API routes
  ↓
💡 Marketplace: "Add Stripe for $29?"
  ↓

```

### Generated App Includes
- ✅ Next.js 14 with App Router
- ✅ TypeScript + React components
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling
- ✅ Todo CRUD operations
- ✅ API routes
- ✅ Stripe checkout integration
- ✅ All necessary config files

### Key Achievements
- **10x Speed**: Built entire POC in 20 minutes

## Next Steps for Full MPCM-Pro
1. Real LLM integration (currently mocked)
2. Actual MCP service orchestration
3. More marketplace roles
4. Database persistence
5. Claude Code agent integration

## Running the Demo
