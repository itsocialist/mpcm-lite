# ðŸš€ MPCM-Pro Quick Start

## What We Just Built

MPCM-Pro is now a REAL AI orchestration platform that:
- âœ… Uses actual LLMs (Claude/GPT) instead of mocked responses
- âœ… Runs as an MCP server for Claude Desktop
- âœ… Orchestrates multiple AI roles (PM, Frontend, Backend)
- âœ… Includes a marketplace with premium roles (Stripe Expert)
- âœ… Generates real, working Next.js applications

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure API Key

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your Claude or OpenAI API key
```

### 2. Test AI Integration

```bash
npm run test:ai
```

This will build a simple todo app using real AI to verify everything works.

### 3. Configure Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mpcm-pro": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/full/path/to/mpcm-poc-spike/src/mcp-server.ts"],
      "env": {
        "LLM_PROVIDER": "claude",
        "LLM_API_KEY": "your-actual-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Restart Claude Desktop

After adding the config, restart Claude Desktop completely.

## Using MPCM-Pro in Claude

Once configured, you can use these commands in Claude:

```
"Use the build_app tool to create a todo app with authentication"

"Build me a recipe sharing app with user accounts and search"

"Create a SaaS starter with Stripe payments" (will suggest marketplace role)
```

## Architecture Overview

```
User â†’ Claude Desktop â†’ MPCM-Pro MCP Server
                              â†“
                     AI Orchestration Engine
                         â†™    â†“    â†˜
                   PM Role  Frontend  Backend
                              â†“
                        Marketplace Roles
                         (Stripe Expert)
                              â†“
                     Generated Next.js App
```

## Current Capabilities

### Base Roles (Free)
- **Product Manager**: Analyzes requirements, creates specs
- **Frontend Developer**: Builds React/Next.js components
- **Backend Developer**: Creates API routes and logic

### Marketplace Roles ($29)
- **Stripe Expert**: Full payment integration with subscriptions

## Cost Breakdown

Typical app generation costs:
- Simple todo app: ~$0.20-0.30
- Complex SaaS app: ~$0.50-1.00
- With Stripe integration: ~$0.70-1.20

## Next Steps

1. **Add More Roles**: Auth expert, Database architect, DevOps
2. **Real Deployment**: Vercel integration for instant hosting
3. **Persistent Memory**: Remember previous projects
4. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple users working together

## Troubleshooting

**"API Key not found"**
- Make sure .env file exists with your key
- Use full path in Claude Desktop config

**"Tool not available in Claude"**
- Restart Claude Desktop completely
- Check the config file JSON is valid
- Look for errors in Console.app (macOS)

**"Build failed"**
- Check you have API credits
- Try a simpler app description first
- Look at the error message for details

## The Magic Moment ðŸŽ‰

When everything is set up correctly, you can literally say:

> "Build me an expense tracker with categories and monthly reports"

And watch as your AI team creates a full application in minutes!

**Remember**: This is production-ready architecture with real AI. The POC proved the concept - now we're delivering the actual product! ðŸš€
